# Eurofly 3 Knowledge database

In this repository I decided to collect all the knowledge about Eurofly 3 game, because according to some rummors there will be no official game manual in text format.

Why GitHub?

1. It is free and will stay here even if the author disappears;
2. Other users can easily contribute by opening pull requests;
3. It supports writing in Markdown without thinking about complex formatting;
4. It is easy to translate to other languages just by adding new pages and linking to them.
